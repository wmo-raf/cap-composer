# CAPComposer

A [Wagtail](https://wagtail.io/)
based [Common Alerting Protocol](https://docs.oasis-open.org/emergency/cap/v1.2/CAP-v1.2-os.html) (CAP) Warning
Composer.

This is a web-based tool for creating and managing CAP alerts. It is designed to be used by National Meteorological and
Hydrological Services (NMHSs) ,disaster management agencies, and other organizations that have the authority to publish
and disseminate CAP alerts.

The **Common Alerting Protocol (CAP)** provides an open, non-proprietary digital message format for all types of alerts
and notifications.

This tool formats published warnings into the CAP XML that follows the structure of the schema provided
at http://docs.oasis-open.org/emergency/cap/v1.2/CAP-v1.2-os.html

## üåü Features

- Modern user-friendly composer that follows [CAP 1.2](http://docs.oasis-open.org/emergency/cap/v1.2/CAP-v1.2-os.html)
  standard. Built on top of the awesome [Wagtail CMS](https://wagtail.org)
- Preview a CAP alert as you edit. Save drafts for sharing with colleagues and collaborating
- Inbuilt CAP validation. The page will not save if you have not input the required data according to CAP standard
- User-friendly alert area map tool that allows multiple ways of constructing alert geographic areas, while keeping the
  interface simple
    - Upload and use your country/territory's administrative boundaries
    - Draw a polygon
    - Draw a circle
    - Selecting predefined areas that you create beforehand for common alert areas
- Inbuilt publishing workflow using Wagtail's powerful page model, with automated emails to composers and approvers
- Collaborate with team members using inbuilt comments (similar to how you could do in Word) with automated
  notifications. Request for changes and approvals
- Publish realtime notifications/messages to third party integrations using MQTT messaging protocol
- Predefine a list of hazards types monitored by your institution, with intuitive icons
  from [OCHA humanitarian icons](https://brand.unocha.org/d/xEPytAUjC3sH/icons#/humanitarian-icons)
- Extendable to add your custom logic and functionality. The package provides an `abstract` django model that can be
  inherited for customizations.

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

CAPComposer can be installed in two ways:

1. As a standalone complete Wagtail project
2. As a set of Wagtail apps that can be integrated into an existing Wagtail project

### Standalone Installation

This option will set up a Wagtail project together with the complete components required to run CAPComposer. Use this
when
you want to have CAPComposer as a standalone project, and not a component in a bigger project.

1. **Clone the repository**

```shell
git clone https://github.com/wmo-raf/cap-composer.git
```

2. **Change into the project directory**

```shell
cd cap-composer
```

3. **Copy the sample environment file**

```shell
cp .env.standalone.sample .env
```

4. **Edit the `.env` file to set your environment variables.** See
   the [Standalone Environment Variables](#standalone-environment-variables)
   below for more information. Use your favourite text editor to edit the file. For example, using `nano`:

```shell
nano .env
```

5. **Copy the nginx configuration file**

```shell
cp nginx/nginx.conf.sample nginx/nginx.conf
```

6. **Copy the docker-compose file**

```shell
cp docker-compose.sample.yml docker-compose.yml
```

7. **Create volumes and set permissions**

CAPComposer uses mounted Docker volumes to store persistent data. The following default directories are used, if not
changed in the `.env` file:

- `./docker/volumes/db` for the database
- `./docker/volumes/static` for static files
- `./docker/volumes/media` for media files
- `./docker/volumes/backup` for backups

Create the directories and set the correct permissions:

```shell
mkdir -p ./docker/volumes/db ./docker/volumes/static ./docker/volumes/media ./docker/volumes/backup

sudo chown -R <UID>:<GID> ./docker/volumes/db ./docker/volumes/static ./docker/volumes/media ./docker/volumes/backup
````

Replace `<UID>` and `<GID>` with the user id and group id to be used by the Docker containers.
This is set in the `.env` file as `UID` and `GID`. See
the [Standalone Environment Variables](#standalone-environment-variables) section for more details.

8. **Build the Docker containers**

```shell
docker compose build
```

This may take some time to download and build the required Docker images, depending on your internet connection.

9. **Run the Docker containers**

```shell
docker compose up -d
```

10. **Check the logs to ensure everything is running correctly**

```shell
docker compose logs -f
```

In case of any errors, see the troubleshooting section below for some helpful
tips [Troubleshooting standalone installation](#troubleshooting-standalone-installation)

11. **Access the application at `http://<ip_or_doman>:<CAP_COMPOSER_WEB_PROXY_PORT>`**. Replace `<ip_or_domain>` with
    the
    IP
    address or domain name of your server, and `<CAP_COMPOSER_WEB_PROXY_PORT>` with the port set in the `.env` file or
    `80`
    if not set.

12. **Create a superuser to access the admin dashboard**

```shell
docker compose exec capcomposer capcomposer createsuperuser
```

`capcomposer` is a shortcut command to `python manage.py` in the Docker container.

13. **Access the admin dashboard at `http://<ip_or_doman>:<CAP_COMPOSER_WEB_PROXY_PORT>/<ADMIN_URL_PATH>`**. Replace
    `<ADMIN_URL_PATH>` with the path set in the `.env` file or `cap-admin` if not set.

#### Standalone Environment Variables

**Note**: For a quick start, **5 environment variables are required**:

- **SECRET_KEY**
- **DB_PASSWORD**
- **REDIS_PASSWORD**
- **UID**
- **GID**

The rest are optional and can be configured as required.

#### Important Notes:

1. **Required Variables**: Ensure `SECRET_KEY`, `DB_PASSWORD`, `REDIS_PASSWORD`, `UID` and `GID` are set, for the
   minimal
   configuration.
2. **Security**: Avoid using default values for sensitive variables like `SECRET_KEY` or `ADMIN_URL_PATH`.
3. **Debug Mode**: Never set `DEBUG=True` in production.
4. **Time Zone**: Set `TIME_ZONE` to your local time zone for accurate timestamps.
5. **SMTP**: Configure email settings to be able to send emails from the system.

#### Troubleshooting standalone installation

1. **Docker containers not starting**: Check the logs for any errors. Run `docker compose logs -f` to see the logs.
2. **Docker compose file parsing errors**: Ensure the `docker-compose.yml` file is correctly formatted. Check for any
   syntax errors. Use `docker compose config` to validate the file. Some symbols like dollar signs `($)` or `@` might be
   the culprit in password variables, especially `DB_PASSWORD`. Check your password and other variables for any special
   characters that might be causing issues.
3. **Database/Static/media/backup volume permission errors**: Ensure the `DB_VOLUME_PATH`,`STATIC_VOLUME_PATH`,
   `MEDIA_VOLUME_PATH`and `BACKUP_VOLUME_PATH` env variables are correctly set. Ensure the user running the CAPComposer
   containers has the correct permissions to read and write to these volume paths. This is the user set by the `UID` and
   `GID`environment variables. Set the correct permissions by running `sudo chown -R <UID>:<GID>  ./path/to/volume`, for
   all the volumes. Replace `<UID>` and `<GID>` with the values set in the `.env` file.
